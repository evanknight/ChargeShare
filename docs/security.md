# Public repository safeguards

## Data boundary

This repository must contain only public-safe source, plans, and synthetic test
fixtures. Never copy secrets or source from private, workplace, vehicle-provider,
or existing application repositories into it. Do not commit real VINs, location
history, charging-session exports, account identifiers, invoices, access tokens,
private keys, or screenshots/logs containing these values. Use `.invalid` domains
and clearly fictional identifiers in examples.

`.env.example` is the only allowed environment template. Keep it to empty values
or unmistakably inert placeholders. `.gitignore` is a convenience, not a security
boundary: ignored files can still be force-added, and previously tracked files
stay tracked. The sensitive-path check separately inspects Git's index.

## Local setup

Requires Git, Node.js 24, Bash, curl, tar, and SHA-256 tooling. From the repository:

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
bash scripts/security/install-gitleaks.sh
bash scripts/security/install-hooks.sh
```

The installer downloads Gitleaks 8.30.1 from its official GitHub release, verifies
a SHA-256 digest pinned in the script, and installs it only into ignored
`.tools/bin/`. It supports Linux and macOS on x64 or arm64. Review upstream release
notes and refresh the version and digests together when upgrading. On other
platforms, use an official 8.30.1 binary on PATH, or run the checks in Linux/WSL.

The hooks installer sets this checkout's `core.hooksPath` to `.githooks` and refuses
to overwrite a different configured hooks path. Cloning does not install hooks.
The pre-commit hook checks staged content. The pre-push hook checks all available
local Git history. Both fail closed if the scanner or required runtime is missing.

## Before every publication

```sh
git diff --cached --check
bash scripts/security/scan.sh staged
bash scripts/security/scan.sh history
npm exec -- openspec validate --all --strict --no-interactive
```

Run `node scripts/security/test-guards.mjs` to exercise the guardrails against
synthetic fixtures in a temporary repository.

Inspect `git diff --cached` manually as well. Verify `.env.example` contains only
placeholders and every fixture is fictional. Review commit author metadata before
publishing; use a verified GitHub noreply address when personal email privacy
matters. Do not copy credentials into commands or command output.

Gitleaks extends its built-in rules without blanket allowlists. Scan output uses
100% secret redaction; inline allow comments and `.gitleaksignore` are ignored by
the wrapper. Do not create baselines that hide an unresolved exposure. Review
false positives carefully rather than disabling a rule or bypassing hooks.

## CI and limits

GitHub Actions scans tracked paths and complete fetched history and validates all
OpenSpec artifacts. Actions are pinned to immutable commit IDs; Gitleaks downloads
are checksum-pinned. Workflow permissions are read-only, checkout does not retain
credentials, and no repository secrets are required.

A scanner does not prove the absence of secrets or identify all personal data.
Local hooks can be bypassed. CI runs after content is uploaded, so it cannot undo a
public disclosure. Manual review and scanning before the first push are essential.
Hosted secret scanning, push protection, private vulnerability reporting, and
branch/ruleset enforcement are separate repository settings; their presence is
not established by committing this workflow. Maintainers should review the
available settings before accepting contributions.

This scaffold does not implement authentication, encryption, consent, retention,
tenant isolation, or vehicle API security. Those controls require a separate
implementation and security review before any real data is connected.
